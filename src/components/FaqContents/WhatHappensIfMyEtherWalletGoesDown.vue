      Kallet is not a web wallet. You don't have a login, and nothing ever gets
      saved to our servers. It is simply an interface that allows you to
      interact with the blockchain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Kallet.com goes down, you would have to find another way (like kalgo or
      Ethereum Wallet / Mist) to do what we are doing. But you wouldn't have to
      "get" your KAL out of Kallet because it's not in Kallet. It's in whatever
      wallet your generated via our site.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can import your unencrypted private key and your Geth/Mist Format
      (encrypted) files directly into geth / Ethereum Wallet / Mist very easily.
